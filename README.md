# Why make Jarvis?
Utilizing libraries to make an AI assistant that's tailored to my own experience has boosted my productivity in work, school, and life.
Not only that, but I've learned valuable python, HTML, and problem solving skills while in persuit of making a valuable AI assistant.

# Interactions
Jarvis interactions allow for more personable and human-like interactions compared to only using ChatGPT.
The use of AI vision in both the laptop screen and camera, is more convenient for studying, writing, math operations, or standard queries which require more context.
Jarvis accesses information from the NWS (National Weather Service), which allows for real-time updates in the desired area; something ChatGPT alone cannot do.
These interactions being accompanied by spotify, youtube, timers, and text messaging functions; creates an even more enhanced experience for the user.
